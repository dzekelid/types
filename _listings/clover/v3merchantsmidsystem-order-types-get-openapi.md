  title: Clover Return a list of system order types
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Merchants can create custom Order Types via "/v3/merchants/{mId}/order_types".
    It is useful to associate these custom order types with particular system order
    types in order to group things functionally. For example, a merchant may have
    a "Lunch Take-Out" order type and a "Dinner Take-Out" order type. These two order
    types can be associated with the "TAKE-OUT-TYPE" system order type so that applications
    can understand that they are both take-out order types.

      summary: Get all order types for a merchant
      description: Merchants have the ability to create custom order types via the
        Setup App (https://www.clover.com/setupapp). These custom order types can
        be associated with a System Order Type (see /v3/merchants/{mId}/system_order_types).
        Custom Order Types can support items in all categories (filterCategories=false)
        or a subset of the merchant's categories (filterCategories=true and categories
        property contains the list of supported categories). Note that when expanding
        the categories for an order type, they will only be returned if this orderType
        only supports a subset of the categories (filterCategories=true). If the orderType
        supports all categories (filterCategories=false) then you should make a GET
        request to /v3/merchants/{mId}/categories.
