description: AWS IoT is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily
  and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support
  billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages
  to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT, your
  applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time,
  even when they aren&rsquo;t connected.AWS IoT makes it easy to use AWS services
  like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon DynamoDB,
  Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service with built-in
  Kibana integration, to build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze and
  act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage any infrastructure.
