      summary: Query active event types
      description: |-
        Event types are used to model the events that are published to the
        Watson IoT Platform.  An event type must be created in an organization
        before more complex processing can be performed on the native event.

        The **/event/types** endpoint returns the list of all of the active
        event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson
        IoT Platform.  Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and
        page through the list of active event types that are returned.
