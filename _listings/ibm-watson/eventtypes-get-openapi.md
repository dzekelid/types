  title: IBM Watson IoT Platform Query active event types
  description: |-
    Event types are used to model the events that are published to the
    Watson IoT Platform.  An event type must be created in an organization
    before more complex processing can be performed on the native event.

    The **/event/types** endpoint returns the list of all of the active
    event types that have been defined for the organization in the Watson
    IoT Platform.  Various query parameters can be used to filter, sort and
    page through the list of active event types that are returned.
