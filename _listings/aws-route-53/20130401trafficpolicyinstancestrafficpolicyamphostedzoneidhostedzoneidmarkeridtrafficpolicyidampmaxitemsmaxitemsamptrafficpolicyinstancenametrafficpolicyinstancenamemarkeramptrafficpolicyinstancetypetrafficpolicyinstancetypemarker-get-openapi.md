  title: AWS Route 53 API List Traffic Policy Instances By Policy
  version: 1.0.0
  description: 'Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created
    by using a specifytraffic policy version.NoteAfter you submit a CreateTrafficPolicyInstance
    or anUpdateTrafficPolicyInstance request, there''s a brief delay while Amazon
    Route 53creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic policy
    definition. Formore information, see the State response element.Send a GET request
    to the /Route 53 APIversion/trafficpolicyinstance resource and include the ID
    and version ofthe traffic policy.Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items
    in each response. If you have a lot of trafficpolicy instances, you can use the
    MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of upto 100.The response includes five
    values that help you navigate from one group ofMaxItems traffic policy instances
    to the next:             IsTruncated               If the value of IsTruncated
    in the response is true,there are more traffic policy instances associated with
    the specified trafficpolicy.If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the
    lasttraffic policy instance that is associated with the specified traffic policy.             MaxItems               The
    value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the requestthat produced
    the current response.                  HostedZoneIdMarker, TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker,
    and TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker               If IsTruncated is true, these
    values in the responserepresent the first traffic policy instance in the next
    group of MaxItemstraffic policy instances. To list more traffic policy instances,
    make another call toListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy, and specify these values
    in thecorresponding request parameters.If IsTruncated is false, all three elements
    are omittedfrom the response.'

      summary: List Resource Record Sets
      description: 'Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.            ListResourceRecordSets
        returns up to 100 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning
        at a position specified by the name and type elements. The action sorts results
        first by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example:            com.example.www.         Note
        the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.When
        multiple records have the same DNS name, the action sorts results by the record
        type.You can use the name and type elements to adjust the beginning position
        of the list of resource record sets returned:If you do not specify Name or
        TypeThe results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone
        contains.If you specify Name but not TypeThe results begin with the first
        resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name.If
        you specify Type but not NameAmazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.If
        you specify both Name and TypeThe results begin with the first resource record
        set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name, and whose type
        is greater than or equal to Type.This action returns the most current version
        of the records. This includes records that are PENDING, and that are not yet
        available on all Amazon Route 53 DNS servers.To ensure that you get an accurate
        listing of the resource record sets for a hosted zone at a point in time,
        do not submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request while you''re paging through
        the results of a ListResourceRecordSets request. If you do, some pages may
        display results without the latest changes while other pages display results
        with the latest changes.'

      summary: Change Resource Record Sets
      description: 'Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information
        on all Amazon Route 53 servers.Send a POST request to:             /2013-04-01/hostedzone/Amazon
        Route 53 hosted ZoneID/rrset resource. The request body must include a document
        with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a
        list ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
        transactional changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource
        record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change
        batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements
        theintended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example,
        a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and
        creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53
        deletesthe first resource record set and creates the second resource record
        set in a singleoperation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails,
        thenboth changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original
        CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue to the nature of transactional
        changes, you can''t delete the same resourcerecord set more than once in a
        single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same changebatch more than
        once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo create resource
        record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic flow
        visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
        policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic
        policy, then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such
        as example.com) or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted
        zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new
        configuration isn''t performing as expected. For more information, seeUsing
        Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use
        ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:                  CREATE:
        Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.                  DELETE:
        Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.                  UPSERT:
        If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource
        set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
        The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource
        record set that you''re creating, deleting, or updating:            Basic
        resource record sets (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and
        weighted resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                           Failover,
        geolocation, latency, or weighted resource record sets (excluding alias resource
        record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                                 SetIdentifier                           Alias
        resource record sets (including failover alias, geolocation alias, latency
        alias, and weighted alias resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 AliasTarget
        (includes DNSName, EvaluateTargetHealth, and HostedZoneId)                  SetIdentifier
        (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When
        you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates
        your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While
        your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When
        propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally
        propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances,
        propagation can take up to 30 minutes. For more information, see GetChange       For
        information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits
        in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.'
