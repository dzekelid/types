  title: AWS Route 53 API List Resource Record Sets
  version: 1.0.0
  description: 'Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.            ListResourceRecordSets
    returns up to 100 resource record sets at a time in ASCII order, beginning at
    a position specified by the name and type elements. The action sorts results first
    by DNS name with the labels reversed, for example:            com.example.www.         Note
    the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances.When multiple
    records have the same DNS name, the action sorts results by the record type.You
    can use the name and type elements to adjust the beginning position of the list
    of resource record sets returned:If you do not specify Name or TypeThe results
    begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.If you
    specify Name but not TypeThe results begin with the first resource record set
    in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name.If you specify Type but
    not NameAmazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.If you specify both Name
    and TypeThe results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose
    name is greater than or equal to Name, and whose type is greater than or equal
    to Type.This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes
    records that are PENDING, and that are not yet available on all Amazon Route 53
    DNS servers.To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record
    sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets
    request while you''re paging through the results of a ListResourceRecordSets request.
    If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes while other
    pages display results with the latest changes.'
